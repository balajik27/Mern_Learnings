Closure is created whenever a function returns another function and that returned function retains 
access to variables in its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

The purpose of using closures is to create functions with access to variables from their containing (enclosing)
 scope without needing to explicitly pass those variables as arguments every time the function is called.

 The key aspect is that the inner function retains access to variables from its containing (enclosing) scope, forming a closure.

 Usually Closure returns the anonymous function , but we can return named function also. but main purpose is to
 make that inner function access to its lexical scope variables, even after the outer function has finished executing.
